//! Indeo 3 VQ codebook materialisation (per-plane banks + per-frame
//! arena + static delta tables).
//!
//! Spec source: `docs/video/indeo/indeo3/spec/04-vq-codebooks.md`.
//!
//! Round 4 lands the codebook system that the spec/03 VQ_DATA leaf
//! indices reference. It materialises the static + per-frame
//! codebook resources spec/04 documents and resolves a packed
//! codebook entry into the structural pieces the downstream
//! per-cell unpacker consumes:
//!
//! * §1.3 / §2.3 — the static dyad-mode delta table at
//!   `.data + 0x1003d088` (8 KB, 16 banks × 512 B), vendored
//!   verbatim from `tables/region_1003d088.hex` and indexed
//!   `(high_nibble << 9) + col` per the dyad handler at
//!   `IR32_32.DLL!0x10006c2c`. The audit-noted bank-15 row
//!   restriction (§1.3) is surfaced as [`DYAD_BANK15_VALID_ROWS`].
//! * §2.1 — the packed codebook DWORD format: mode bit 0 / bit 1
//!   selecting one of four cell-unpacker variants, and bits 2..31
//!   as a signed (`sar 2`) byte offset into the per-frame arena.
//!   [`CodebookEntry::decode`] performs that split.
//! * §5.1 — the static codebook seed table at `.data + 0x1003ed4c`
//!   (258 B, 129 byte-pairs) and the codec-init routine at
//!   `IR32_32.DLL!0x10006262` that packs each pair into a
//!   512-scaled DWORD ([`seed_dispatch_entries`]), plus the
//!   materialisation of the codec-init-built cell-state dispatch
//!   tables ([`SeedDispatchTables`]) that the spec/04 §5.1 init
//!   function writes from that seed. Audit/00 §4 established that
//!   `DllMain` runs Path 1 (`0x10006262`), so this reproduces the
//!   actually-executed packing for the three **low-half**-stream
//!   tables (`0x1003f24c`, `0x1003f94c`, `0x1003f950`). The three
//!   **high-half**-stream tables (`0x1003f44c`, `0x1003fd4c`,
//!   `0x1003fd50`) source from seed offset `+0x100`; only the single
//!   in-bounds pair is determinable from the 258-byte extract
//!   (audit/00 §2.2) — the rest is a deferred DOCS-GAP.
//! * §1.2 / §6 — the per-frame VQ arena layout
//!   (`*(inner_instance + 0x3004) + 0x800..+0x8800`, 16 bands ×
//!   2 KB) and the `alt_quant[]` band-selection overlay at
//!   `IR32_32.DLL!0x1000646a` ([`VqArena::apply_alt_quant`]).
//! * §4 — the VQ_NULL runtime sub-bit semantics
//!   ([`VqNullRuntime`]).
//!
//! What this round deliberately does **not** do (the spec/04
//! chapter boundary, §0 / §8):
//!
//! * No per-byte mode-byte unpacking, dyad-pair → pixel-pair
//!   expansion, or RLE escape codes — those start at the per-byte
//!   unpacker entry `IR32_32.DLL!0x10006bac` and are
//!   `spec/06-entropy.md`'s subject. spec/04 explicitly defers the
//!   QUAD-mode escape table at `.data + 0x1004ccd4` to spec/06
//!   (§1.3) and ends at "dispatched into the unpacker with the
//!   base pointers loaded" (§8).
//! * No actual pixel reconstruction or 7-bit→8-bit upshift —
//!   `spec/07`.
//! * No motion compensation — `spec/05`.
//!
//! The contract this module provides is the *materialised codebook
//! state* plus the *index → structural-delta resolution* that
//! spec/04 pins down; the structural-delta → pixel emission is the
//! next chapter's job.
