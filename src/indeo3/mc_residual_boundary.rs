//! Indeo 3 spec/05 §5.6 — boundary between the MC fetcher and the
//! VQ residual path.
//!
//! Spec source: `docs/video/indeo/indeo3/spec/05-motion-compensation.md`
//! §5.6 (the two-paragraph disposition that pins the chapter-end of
//! the MC fetcher's inner loop and the chapter-start of the VQ
//! residual path) and cross-references: `spec/04 §3.4` (the
//! per-byte unpacker dispatch entry at `IR32_32.DLL!0x10006bac`),
//! `spec/04 §7.5` (the shared INTER / VQ_DATA leaf-byte table that
//! lets an INTER-flagged cell chain into a VQ_DATA residual via
//! the cell-state byte's chained-flag arithmetic), and `spec/05
//! §5.1` (the MC fetcher inner loop whose final write is the
//! `mov [edi + 0x20c], eax` at `IR32_32.DLL!0x10006732`).
//!
//! Round 14 ([`super::mc_kernel`]) lands the §5.1 / §5.2 inner-loop
//! geometry whose final write this module's [`MC_FETCHER_LAST_WRITE_DST_OFFSET`]
//! pins. Round 20 ([`super::mc_chroma`]) lands the §5.5 chroma-
//! scaling surface that closes the chapter's per-plane disposition.
//! Round 21 (this module) owns §5.6 — the typed surface that pins
//! the chapter boundary itself: the MC chapter ends at the final
//! row-3 write of the inner loop, and the next instruction the
//! spec/06 entropy chapter documents is the per-byte mode read at
//! `IR32_32.DLL!0x10006bac`.
//!
//! This module surfaces:
//!
//! * [`MC_FETCHER_LAST_WRITE_RVA`] — the RVA of the final inner-loop
//!   write (`mov [edi + 0x20c], eax` at
//!   `IR32_32.DLL!0x10006732`).
//! * [`MC_FETCHER_LAST_WRITE_DST_OFFSET`] — the row-3 destination
//!   byte offset (`0x20c`) on the final inner-loop write, equal to
//!   the §5.1 row-3 immediate `0x210` minus the §5.1 `lea edi,
//!   [edi + 0x4]` mid-loop column advance.
//! * [`VQ_RESIDUAL_DISPATCH_RVA`] — the spec/04 §3.4 / §7.5 per-byte
//!   unpacker dispatch entry at `IR32_32.DLL!0x10006bac` where
//!   spec/06 picks up the residual-application chain.
//! * [`MC_CHAPTER_LAST_DST_ROW_INDEX`] — the §5.1 inner loop's
//!   last-written row index (`3`, the fourth row of a 4-row band).
//! * [`MC_INNER_LOOP_BAND_ROWS_ALIAS`] — typed `const`-alias of
//!   [`super::MC_BAND_ROWS`] with a `const _` cross-check that the
//!   final dst row index is exactly `MC_BAND_ROWS - 1`.
//! * [`McCellDisposition`] — typed surface for the §5.6 "what
//!   happens after the MC copy" classification: the cell is either
//!   pure prediction (no residual chains) or prediction-then-
//!   residual (the cell's chained-flag arithmetic per `spec/04
//!   §7.5` re-enters VQ_TREE for the residual).
//! * [`ResidualApplication`] — typed surface for the §5.6 first
//!   paragraph "the residual is added *in place* to the just-written
//!   prediction" disposition (vs the spec/04 §3 direct-intra VQ
//!   path where no MC pre-write exists).
//! * [`McToVqHandoff`] — composite typed surface bundling the MC-
//!   chapter terminator with the spec/06 start point, used by
//!   callers that need to document the chapter boundary at a single
//!   call site.
//! * [`McToVqHandoff::for_disposition`] — returns the typed
//!   handoff matching the cell's [`McCellDisposition`] (the
//!   `PredictionThenResidual` disposition yields the populated
//!   handoff; the `PredictionOnly` disposition yields `None` because
//!   the MC chapter's last write is also the cell's last write in
//!   that case).
//! * [`shares_destination_buffer`] — `const`-`true` predicate
//!   surfacing the §5.6 first-paragraph disposition that the MC
//!   prediction and the VQ residual share the same destination
//!   buffer (the residual is added in place; no copy between two
//!   buffers).
//!
//! What this module **deliberately does not do** (the §5.6 chapter
//! boundary):
//!
//! * It does not perform the MC fetcher inner-loop reads / writes
//!   themselves. The four inner-loop writes are owned by
//!   [`super::mc_kernel`]; this module only pins the disposition
//!   that the last of the four is the chapter terminator.
//! * It does not perform the per-byte mode read at
//!   `IR32_32.DLL!0x10006bac`. That entry point is owned by
//!   [`super::entropy`]'s `0x10006bac` dispatch (per `spec/04 §3.4`,
//!   the mode-byte high-nibble jump table); this module only pins
//!   the RVA at which spec/06's chapter begins.
//! * It does not perform the VQ residual addition itself. The
//!   `add ah, [byte ptr]` site is the spec/06 unpacker territory;
//!   this module only pins the §5.6 first-paragraph disposition
//!   that the addition is in-place over the MC prediction.
//! * It does not classify a cell-state byte as chained or not
//!   chained. That classification is the `spec/04 §7.5`
//!   chained-flag arithmetic territory; this module accepts a
//!   pre-classified [`McCellDisposition`] from the caller.
//! * It does not own the §5.1 inner-loop row layout. The four
//!   per-row destination offsets are owned by
//!   [`super::MC_FULL_PEL_ROW_OFFSETS`]; this module re-uses the
//!   final entry through [`MC_FETCHER_LAST_WRITE_DST_OFFSET`] but
//!   does not re-derive the row layout.
