//! Indeo 3 static-table-only per-cell reconstruction executor.
//!
//! Spec source: `docs/video/indeo/indeo3/spec/06-entropy.md` §3 / §4
//! (the per-cell mode-byte stream + the `0xF8..0xFF` RLE escapes) and
//! `spec/07-output-reconstruction.md` §1 / §3 (the in-cell predictor
//! chain + the static `.data + 0x1003d088` dyad table the high-nibble-0
//! handler reads).
//!
//! ## What this module adds
//!
//! The earlier rounds landed every reconstruction sub-step as an
//! independent caller-driven primitive: [`super::apply_row_band_seed`]
//! (one high-nibble-0 static-table seed write), [`super::emit_cell_chain`]
//! (the predictor chain given *caller-supplied* dyad deltas),
//! [`super::ModeByte::classify`] (one mode-byte classification),
//! [`super::RleEscape::accepted_at`] (one escape's position acceptance).
//! None of them *consumed a mode-byte stream* and *drove the strip
//! buffer* end-to-end.
//!
//! This module owns the per-cell mode-byte **executor**: given a cell's
//! geometry and the slice of mode bytes the per-cell unpacker would read
//! from `[ebp]` (`spec/06 §1.2`), it walks the cell row by row, reads one
//! mode byte per position, and dispatches it to the handler the binary's
//! high-nibble jump table (`spec/06 §3.2`) would select:
//!
//! * **High-nibble-0 literal** (`spec/07 §3.1`/`§3.2`,
//!   `IR32_32.DLL!0x10006c14`) → reads the signed delta byte from the
//!   on-disk static dyad table at `.data + 0x1003d088` and writes it
//!   into the predictor slot one row above ([`super::apply_row_band_seed`]).
//!   This path needs **no per-frame arena**, so it is fully decodable
//!   from the vendored static table.
//! * **RLE skip escapes** `0xFD` / `0xFE` / `0xFF` (`spec/06 §4.2`) →
//!   advance the destination pointer by all-remaining / two / one row
//!   stride(s) without emitting deltas. No table input.
//! * **RLE escape `0xFB`** (`spec/06 §4.4`) → consumes the counter byte
//!   and reports its full decomposition ([`super::FbCounter`]: category,
//!   `(counter & 0x1F) + 1` cell count, copy-vs-mark bit 5); it
//!   terminates the cell, and [`run_cell_sequence`] consumes the counted
//!   following cells.
//! * **Cross-cell escape state** (`spec/06 §4.6` / `§4.2`) → `0xF9` /
//!   `0xFC` toggle the next-cell-skip flag (`ecx` bit 16); the stateful
//!   entry [`reconstruct_cell_stateful`] threads it (a carried flag
//!   consumes the next cell as [`CellOutcome::SkippedByCarry`]), and
//!   [`run_cell_sequence`] drives whole cell runs over one shared
//!   stream with byte-exact cursor accounting ([`CellRun`]).
//! * **Position-faulting escapes** (`spec/06 §4.3`) → the §4.3
//!   acceptance matrix is enforced: an escape emitted at a position
//!   where the binary's per-position dispatch table routes to the fault
//!   handler `0x1000854b` aborts with [`CellReconstructError::EscapeFault`]
//!   (the binary's error-code-1 return).
//!
//! ## What it defers (the codebook-bank docs-gap)
//!
//! A literal mode byte whose **high nibble is non-zero** addresses the
//! per-frame VQ codebook arena (`spec/06 §3.1`: `low_nibble × 2048`
//! selects the band; the dyad-pair DWORD lives in the arena's primary /
//! secondary tables). Those arena values are built at codec-init by
//! `IR32_32.DLL!0x100060de` and are the `spec/04 §7.1` Extractor
//! docs-gap (zero on disk; the §5.2 seed-window materialisation is
//! blocked on the spec-vs-audit `0x1004d26a` block-format contradiction,
//! audit/00 §2.3). Rather than guess, the executor stops at the first
//! such byte and returns [`CellOutcome::DeferredArena`], surfacing
//! *exactly* which mode byte and position the docs-gap bites — the
//! cleanest possible boundary report for the next Extractor round.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! This executor models the **variant-A row-0 plain-dyad** cell shape
//! (`spec/06 §3.4` variant A): one mode byte per dyad-pair position,
//! `source_rows` rows of `width_dwords` positions each, with the §3.2
//! `0x10006bd4` jump-table dispatch. The averaging variants (B/C/D) and
//! the variable-byte continuation (`spec/06 §3.3`) are out of scope for
//! this round because they consume the arena dyad values this module
//! defers; the executor's mission is the *static-table-only* subset.
