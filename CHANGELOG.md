## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Indeo 3 (IV31 / IV32) frame-header parser. `FrameHeader::parse`
  consumes the combined 64-byte header at the start of an Indeo 3
  codec frame (16-byte frame header + 48-byte bitstream header)
  and returns a typed view of every field. Validates the §2.1
  `FRMH` checksum, §2.2 `frame_size > 16` bound, §3.1
  `dec_version == 0x0020`, and §3.2 `YVU9_8BIT` (bit 1) rejection,
  surfacing each failure as a distinct `HeaderError` variant.
  `FrameFlags` provides typed accessors for the named bits
  (PERIODIC_INTRA, INTRA, NEXT_INTRA_HINT, MV_HALFPEL_HORIZ /
  _VERT, DROPPABLE_INTER, BUFFER_SELECTOR) plus an `is_inter`
  helper. The NULL-frame `data_size == 0x80` sentinel is
  recognised by `BitstreamHeader::is_null_frame`. `alt_quant[]`
  is preserved verbatim with an `alt_quant_indices` helper for
  the §3.9 high-nibble / low-nibble VQ-table-index split.
  14 unit tests cover happy path, every error path, the §5 byte
  map, and the `FRMH` magic constant. Spec source:
  `docs/video/indeo/indeo3/spec/01-file-header.md`.

### Changed

- Clean-room rebuild from a fresh orphan `master`. The previous
  implementation was retired by the OxideAV docs audit dated
  2026-05-06; the prior history is preserved on the `old` branch.
  See `README.md` for the rebuild scope and the strict-isolation
  workspace the Implementer rounds will draw from.
